## go-nsxv

This is an NSX client library for Go. The NSX-V REST API schema can be found at VMware's Github. The XML files under
`.\templates\` were generated by Gogland, the Go IDE from Jetbrains. The CLI tool `xmljson2struct` was used to generate
 the
base Go files, and then each file was modified.

```powershell
foreach ($file in gci .\templates\) { $OUTFILE = $file.Name.Replace(".xsd.xml", "");$TYPES =
E:\Programming\Go\bin\xmljson2struct.exe -G .\templates\$file; Write-Output "package go_nsx" $OFS $TYPES $OFS | Out-File .\$OUTFILE.go}
```
